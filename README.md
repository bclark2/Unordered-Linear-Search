# Unordered-Linear-Search
Python data structure and algorithm notes and examples.
In this example the unordered linerar search has a running time that is depenent upon the location
of the number that we are searching for. Therefore it's O(n). The worst case scenario is if the item we
are looking for is at the very end of the list. This is an example of an innefficient search algorithm.
We have to look at every element one by one before we find the one we are looking for. We can do better.
